# Run-3 Trigger Data Visualisation

This code creates plots with some data generated to analyse the
relative performance of the ATLAS Run-2 and Run-3 trigger systems,
during the commissioning of the Phase-I trigger upgrade.

This code matches trigger objects between the two systems based on
coordinates, and visualises the energies of matched objects in a
two-dimensional histogram as well as showing the rate of efficiency of
this matching process as a function of energy in a one-dimensional
histogram.

Data for two runs is included. For an interpretation of these results
and the differences between these runs see my
[thesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hazza4569/thesis/refs/heads/master/thesis.pdf#page=72).
